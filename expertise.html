        <h2>Executive Assessments</h2>
        <p>
            I deliver a range of executive assessments &mdash; be it for development, assessment of potential, succession planning or selection. I work with a range of leaders across levels, from mid-level to C-suite. Leaders I have worked with come from Energy, Manufacturing, Technology, Trading, Private Equity and many other sectors.<br>
            Majority of assessments I deliver are based on the Hogan suite (HPI, HDS, MVPI) and/or Saville Wave; many clients also use proprietary tools and methodologies for which I am happy to be additionally certified.<br>
            <br>
            Whilst many clients hire me to deliver assessments to a format that they specify, I am also skilled in designing bespoke approaches, including recommendation on which tools to use, as well as developing suitable reporting formats.<br>
            <br>
            I pride myself on my clear report-writing, always adapting to clients&CloseCurlyQuote; expectations in terms of &OpenCurlyQuote;house style&CloseCurlyQuote;. Quality, clarity and attention to detail are very important to me and as a result, I have often been asked to provide quality assurance for other associates&CloseCurlyQuote; reports.<br>
            <br>
            Examples of work in this area include: 
            <ul>
                <li>Multiple senior executive selection and development assessments (C-suite level) for Private Equity backed companies across sectors and geographies.</li>
                <li>Series of succession-mapping assessments for a major international renewable energy developer.</li>
                <li>Mid-level leader individual development assessments for an international energy company, involving:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Assessment centre structure with multiple exercises delivered virtually, including simulations, role-plays, interviews;</li>
                        <li>In-depth structured report against multiple client-specific behavioural competencies;</li>
                        <li>Verbal debrief of results with client&CloseCurlyQuote;s Talent / HR team;</li>
                        <li>Feedback and developmental debrief session with the candidate.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>360-degree survey assessments, reports and feedback (both written and verbal 360s) for mid- to senior-level leaders globally.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Leadership Development</h2>
        <p>
            I am highly skilled in designing and leading complex, often bespoke, leadership development programmes across a range of leadership levels. My particular strength is the ability to effectively diagnose key capability gaps in individuals, teams and populations, based on developing a strong understanding of success factors in particular business contexts. My approach to design could be described as creative yet disciplined. As a facilitator and coach, I bring experience and credibility.
